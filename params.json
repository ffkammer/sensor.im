This device equipped with DHT22 temperature-humidity sensor. \r\n\r\nCurrent (ZSA1-E model) Features:\r\n\r\n1. Measures temperature and humidity using calibrated digital sensor\r\n2. Direct monitoring with Zabbix Server (behave like Zabbix agent in passive mode)\r\n3. Can support PoE 802.3 (need special Ethernet Shield with PoE support)\r\n4. Cheap: 50~60$ for all parts price (based on Alibaba and Sparkfun prices, shipping included)\r\n5. Can be easy assembled (minimal soldering and enclosure modification)\r\n6. Web based network setting setup (save network settings in EEPROM) \r\n\r\nIt's firmware and design will be free and open source. Also Wi-Fi version (with the same form factor) and support for additional sensors (dust, motion, light, Co2..etc) will be implemented in near future.\r\n\r\n![ZSA1-E](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-27lLNB3IDv0/UJOncSsGcQI/AAAAAAABMKI/ofErJhj9w0o/s512/IMG-20121102-00209.jpg)"}
